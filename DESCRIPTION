Description: Implementation of T. Hailperin's procedure to calculate lower and upper bounds of the probability for a propositional-logic expression, given equality and inequality constraints on the probabilities for other expressions. Truth-valuation is included as a special case. Applications range from decision-making and probabilistic reasoning, to pedagogical for probability and logic courses. For more details see T. Hailperin (1965) <doi:10.1080/00029890.1965.11970533>, T. Hailperin (1996) "Sentential Probability Logic" ISBN:0-934223-45-9, and package documentation. Requires the 'lpSolve' package.
